Note any new thing you learnt or any thing that got you confused




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Project - UX Phase
#### Tasks
Design a tenant finder and communication app that will allow landlords to find and communicate with potential tenants directly without any dealer. It will also allow tenants to communicate with their existing landlords regarding property issues, maintenance requirements, pay rents, etc.

> - Use the UX techniques you’ve been taught since week one (i.e user research, user stories, user flow, wireframing etc.) to carry out this exercise. Once you’ve gotten all you need, begin writing a case study on what you were able to discover.
> - Your case study should have the problem statement, personas, information architecture, wireframes, and your UX design process in general.




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

### Project - UI Phase
#### Tasks
> - Convert your wireframes into high fidelity screens
> - Prototype your high fidelity screens
> - Complete your case study




&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Project - Testing and Publishing
#### Tasks
> - Test your prototype with users to look out for usability issues
> - Test your work against the heuristics evaluations
> - Document your findings in your case study
> - Publish your work on your portfolio


# More by MLSC 

> The “UI” in UI design stands for “user interface.” The user interface is the graphical layout of an application, while the “UX” stands for “user experience.” A user’s experience of the app is determined by how they interact with it. ~ [UX Planet](https://uxplanet.org/what-is-ui-vs-ux-design-and-the-difference-d9113f6612de)
